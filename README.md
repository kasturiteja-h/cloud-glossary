Hi, I’m Teja

🌩 Aspiring Cloud Practitioner | Future Cloud Expert

🚀 I’ve recently started my 6-month journey to become a Cloud Computing Expert.

📚 Currently learning: Cloud Basics (AWS) Linux, and Networking.

🎯 Goal: Achieve AWS, Azure, and GCP certifications while building 24+ real-world projects and sharing them on GitHub.

💻 My projects will include:

Cloud-hosted applications

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)

CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions

Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)


🌱 Each week I’ll add a new cloud project repo, documenting my learning path.
